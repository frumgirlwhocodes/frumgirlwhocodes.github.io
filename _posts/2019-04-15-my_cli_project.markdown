 Then the final CLI project was introduced, I got a little nervouse. thoughts like " How do I start coding on my own", or "How do i come up with a idea and the code to go with it?" 
However, when I strated to brianstorm an idea, all the information I learnt in from flatiorn came flooding through my mind and a idea poped in my head. I should make a library finder. I looked through many websites for information to scrape. With the help of my techinical coach, i was able to scrape the infomation I needed and to create my project.

This project was accually hard for me due to many  good and bad situations that were going on in my life at that time. I got engaged to a wounderful man and we are scheduled to get married in September. however, my grandmother went into cardiac arrest and was put on a respirator in the ICU. My Family and I took chances staying by her bedside. ferthermore, i am a religious Jew and the holiday of Passover was on the harizon. There is a lot of peperation that goes into this holiday. At the end of the day, I was very busy and had very little time to really focus on my project. I am writting this blog now, even though I am not completely done my project because I feel like it is the most apporpriate time.  I have all the classes and methods I need to create my app. All I need to do is make it work. 

Now that I am at the end of my project, I feel a great sence of accomplishment( and tirdness). I am fully read to embrace the new code and information that Flatiorn has to teach me. I can not wait till the next project!
