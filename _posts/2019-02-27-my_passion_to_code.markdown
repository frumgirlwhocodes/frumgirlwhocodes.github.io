Throughout my school years, I have always loved math and trying to figure out problems. I always excelled at it and enjoyed it. Therefore, I always knew that I wanted to become a software developer and learn how to code. Furthermore, I find the whole aspect of coding fascinating. How can this piece of metal give a computer the knowledge to be able to preform the tasks asked of them? Essentially, computers and other technical devices are useless, however, because of the code that developers create these devices are able to perform almost human like tasks. This concept boggles my mind and makes me want to learn how to be one of those developers.

Since I started to learn to code, I have encountered many peers that are also learning computer science and software development. When my friends and I  started to converse, we would have lengthy and passionate conversations about code. I loved tiling about it. This reinforced my desire to code because it showed me how passionate I really am about becoming a software developer and learning to code.

I hope to always have the will and the passion to continue to learn and excel in my path to become a software developer.
