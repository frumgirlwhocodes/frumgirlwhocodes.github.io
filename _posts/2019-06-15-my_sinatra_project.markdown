I love to cook and bake. I keep all my recipes on index cards in a box. However, I find that they always et dirty and sometimes the specific recipe I am looking for is hard to find.  When I started brainstorming for an idea for the Sinatra Project, a great idea popped in to my head. I would create a Sinatra web application that has all the recipes displayed for a specific user. You would need to sign up and/or log in to get into your account. No one can see your secret recipes. Now I do not have to keep all my recipes on paper. If you want to send one of your recipes to someone, you can. 

	I am still new to coding and Software Engineering, so my app is not so complex yet. However, I really love this idea. I hope to be able to build up and make my project more complex as I get deeper into my coding journey.
