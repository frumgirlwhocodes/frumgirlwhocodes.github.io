When I started brainstorming an idea for my rails project, I kept on doing back to my idea for the Sinatra project. I really wanted to implement the idea with rails and add more features to the app. So, I created a recipe app using ruby on rails. 

I love to cook and have numerous recipes. Sometimes I find it hard to keep them all organized on cards and they get very dirty and ruined. Therefore, I love this idea of keeping all your recipes organized and saved through an application. Additionally, I am able to use my skills I learnt through flatiron to create it. 

I did find this project more challenging but also a lot more fun and rewarding because of the hard work I put in.
I still have more to go and hope I can continue learning.
