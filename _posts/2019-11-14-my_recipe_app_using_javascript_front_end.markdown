In my recipe app you sign in and can create, edit, and veiw all your recipes. On each recipeshow page you can add comments witout the page rerendering using Javascript and Ruby on Rails. I incorperted javascript into y app. On each recipe show page I created a link that get the next recipe in your account without a page refresh. the format is in a json format. You can view the recipe in a json format.  on the index page aka list of recipes, I added Javascript code that uses Jquery to retreive that recipe description attribute and display it without a page refresh.  I also created Javascript code that uses a comment class and a method on its protoype to create comments on a recipe and then the data gets inserted into the DOM. 
​
I personally found this project to be hard and challenging. Due to getting married, moving, and my Jewish Holidays I had very litt;e time and had to tale many breaks which made it very hard. therefore i am proud of whta i created and see how much I love to code and create programs 
​
I hope to finish this program and become a bad ass programmer.
